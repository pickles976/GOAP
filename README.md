# GOAP

This is a Typescript implementation of Goal-Oriented Action Planning for basic agents. The original code was heavily based off this repo:

[GOAP reference code](https://github.com/viniciusgerevini/godot-goap)

The toy example should run a game similar to Settlers of CATAN with 3 agents:
- Road Agent
- Village Agent
- City Agent

All agents should seek to build as many roads, villages, or cities as possible.
